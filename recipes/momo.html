    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This stuffed dumpling preparation is one of the most popular dishes in Nepal. This dish is an example of Tibetan influence in Nepali cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2lbs lean ground meat (50% lamb or chicken & 50% pork works best)</li>
            
        <li>1 cup red onion, finely chopped</li>
            
        <li>1 cup green onion, finely chopped</li>
        
        <li>3 up ripe tomatoes, finely chpped</li>
            
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh garlic, minced</li>
            
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, freshly grated</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>

        <li>3 tablespoon curry powder, or momo masala if available</li>
            
        <li>3 fresh red chilies, minced (or to taste)</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoons cooking oil</li>

        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dough: In a large bowl combine flour, oil, salt and water.</li>
            <li>Mix well, knead until the dough becomes homogeneous in texture, about 8-10 minute</li>
            <li>Cover and let stand for at least 30 minute.</li>
            <li>Knead well again before making wrappers.</li>
            <li>Filling: In a large bowl combine all filling ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix well, adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow all ingredients to impart their unique flavors.</li>
            <li>This also improves the consistency of the filling.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Assembly</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Give the dough a final knead.</li>
            <li>Prepare 1-in. dough balls.</li>
            <li>Take a ball, roll between your palms to spherical shape.</li>
            <li>Dust working board with dry flour.</li>
            <li>On the board gently flatten the ball with your palm to about 2-in circle.</li>
            <li>Make a few semi-flattened circles, cover with a bowl.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to roll out each flattened circle into a wrapper.</li>
            <li>For well executed MOMO's, it is essential that the middle portion of the wrapper be slightly thicker than the edges to ensure the structural integrity of dumplings during packing and steaming.</li>
            <li>Hold the edges of the semi-flattened dough with one hand and with the other hand begin rolling the edges of the dough out, swirling a bit at a time.</li>
            <li>Continue until the wrapper attains 3-in diameter circular shape.</li>
            <li>For packing hold wrapper on one palm, put one tablespoon of filling mixture and with the other hand bring all edges together to the center, making the pleats</li>
            <li>Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the stuffed dumpling.</li>
            <li>Heat up a steamer, oil the steamer rack well.</li>
            <li>This is critical because it will prevent dumplings from sticking.</li>
            <li>Close the lid, and allow steaming until the dumplings are cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take dumplings off the steamer and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
    
    </ul>

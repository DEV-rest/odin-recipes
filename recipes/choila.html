    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless buff meat -500 grams</li>
        <li>Ginger about 2 inches</li>
        <li>Garlic - 5 to 6 cloves</li>
        <li>Tomatoes- 3 medium size</li>
        <li>Salt- 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder -half teaspoon</li>
        <li>Fenugreek seeds - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Dried red chili - 6 to 7 pieces</li>
        <li>Oil - 6 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Green garlic - half cup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to boil boneless buff meat. Take a pressure cooker, put 500 grams boneless buff meat, pour water, add half teaspoon turmeric powder and half tablespoon salt.
             Stir it. Put on the pressure lid and cook the meat for 7 to 8 whistles.</li>
        <li>Now you have to fry dried red chili. For that, you need to take a pan and heat two tablespoons.
            When the oil is heated, add seven dried red chilies. Let them fry for about 30 seconds. Stir while frying.</li>
        <li>After that, add six garlic cloves and roughly chopped garlic. You need to fry it for another half minute. Donâ€™t fry them for more than 30 or 35 seconds</li>
        <li>Transfer the fried spices to the bowl. Allow the spices to cool. You will need them in the coming steps.
            In the same oil, you can fry tomatoes. Roughly chop three medium-size tomatoes and add them to the oil. 
            Cover the pan with the lid and allow them to cook for 3 minutes on low flame.</li>
        <li>After the meat is chopped, you need to fry them in the same pan you used in the previous steps. Add three tablespoons of oil and heat it in a medium flame.
            When the oil is heated, add the chopped meat. Keep stirring the meat so that all the sides are cooked evenly. 
            Fry them in low-medium flame.</li>
        <li>Now you need to make a paste for buff choila. Take the fried whole spices (dried red chilies, ginger, and garlic cloves), and fried tomatoes, then put them in the blender and blend until you get a smooth paste.
            After the paste is ready, transfer it into the bowl. Add half tablespoon salt and give it a mix. You can increase or decrease the salt according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Now you need to combine paste and fried meat. In the bowl of paste, add the fried meat. Use your hands to rub each piece of meat with the paste.
            Again you need to heat three tablespoons of oil in the pan. After the oil is heated, add one tablespoon of fenugreek seeds. You need to do this process in low flame.</li>
        <li>After the fenugreek seeds turn black, turn off the flame and add half a teaspoon of turmeric powder. Pour it in the bowl of meat. Use a spoon to mix. After a while, you can also use your hands to massage the meat. This ensures that masala enters each piece of meat.
            After that, you need to add finely chopped green ginger. Again use your hands to mix.
            
            Now buff choila is all ready to serve.</li>
